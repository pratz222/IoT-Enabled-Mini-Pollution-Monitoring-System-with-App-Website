EcoConnect: IoT Enabled Mini Pollution Monitoring System integrated with App and Website

The proposed system utilizes MQ135 gas sensor, DHT11 sensor, and BMP280 pressure sensor to accurately measure pollution and Air Quality Index (AQI) levels for environment monitoring. The data collected by these sensors is transmitted to Firebase (RTDB) and then it is fetched by an Android application. This application serves as a user-friendly interface, providing real-time updates and alerts on air quality. The entire hardware setup is concised to the size of an Ipod for portability and easy installation.

One of the unique features of this application is its ability to issue voice alerts, image changes and alert notifications when pollution levels exceed thresholds. This feature ensures that users are promptly informed about potential health risks, enabling them to take necessary precautions. It can also be easily integrated with Smart Home devices.
